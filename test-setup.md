# Testing Video and Image Support

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create the content directory structure:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p content/thumbnails
   ```

2. **Add some test files:**
   - Place some `.mp4` or `.mov` video files in the `content/` directory
   - Place some image files (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc.) in the `content/` directory

3. **Update the scripts with your actual paths:**
   Edit both `compress.sh` and `dirmonitor.sh` and replace:
   ```bash
   input_directory="<directory of content>"
   output_directory="<directory of thumbnails>"
   ```
   
   With your actual paths, for example:
   ```bash
   input_directory="/var/www/html/images/content"
   output_directory="/var/www/html/images/content/thumbnails"
   ```

4. **Test your setup (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   chmod +x test-thumbnails.sh
   ./test-thumbnails.sh
   ```

5. **Generate thumbnails:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x compress.sh
   ./compress.sh
   ```

6. **Start the directory monitor (optional):**
   ```bash
   chmod +x dirmonitor.sh
   sudo screen ./dirmonitor.sh
   ```
